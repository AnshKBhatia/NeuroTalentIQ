NeuroTalent IQ Model
Cross-Validation Technique with Text Cleaning Overview

This Python script demonstrates a unique cross-validation technique using stratified K-Fold to evaluate models trained on preprocessed text data. The preprocessing involves cleaning text data such as resumes by removing URLs, mentions, hashtags, punctuations, and non-ASCII characters.
Features

    Text Cleaning: The clean_function removes URLs, mentions, hashtags, punctuations, and non-ASCII characters from text data.

    Stratified K-Fold Cross-Validation: Ensures that each fold of data retains the distribution of resume lengths for improved model evaluation.

    Model Evaluation: Evaluates models using stratified K-Fold cross-validation with accuracy scoring.

Usage
Dependencies:

    Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.
    Install required libraries using pip install -r requirements.txt.

Input Data:

    Provide a list of resumes (texts) and corresponding labels (labels) if applicable.

Running the Script:

    Modify the model_list, X_train, and y_train variables according to your specific use case.
    Execute the script to perform stratified K-Fold cross-validation and evaluate the models.
